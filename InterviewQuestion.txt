15. Types of tag in html?
Container Tags:
Container tags are HTML elements that wrap around content, creating a distinct block or section within the document. These tags come in pairs, with an opening tag and a corresponding closing tag. They encapsulate content to apply styling, structure, or functionality to that content. Examples of container tags include <div>, <span>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, <nav>, etc.
Example:

html
Copy code
<div>
    <p>This is some content wrapped in a div container.</p>
</div>
Empty Tags (Self-closing Tags):
Empty tags, also known as self-closing tags, are HTML elements that don't contain any content between an opening and closing tag. They stand alone and typically represent elements that don't require inner content, such as images, line breaks, or inputs. These tags don't need a closing tag because they are self-contained.

Examples:

html
Copy code
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
<br>
<input type="text" name="username">
