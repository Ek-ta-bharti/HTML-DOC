<!-- 
`<ul>` and `<ol>` are both HTML elements used for creating lists, but they have different purposes and render differently on the web page. -->

    <!-- 1. **Unordered List (`<ul>`)**:
       - Represents a list of items in no particular order.
       - Each item in the list is typically preceded by a bullet point.
       - Commonly used for navigation menus, lists of items, or any list where the order of items is not significant.
       - Example:
         ```html
         <ul>
             <li>Item 1</li>
             <li>Item 2</li>
             <li>Item 3</li>
         </ul>
         ```
    
    2. **Ordered List (`<ol>`)**:
       - Represents a list of items in a specific order.
       - Each item in the list is preceded by a number or another ordered marker (like letters or Roman numerals).
       - Used when the sequence of items is important, such as steps in a process, rankings, or any ordered set of items.
       - Example:
         ```html
         <ol>
             <li>Step 1</li>
             <li>Step 2</li>
             <li>Step 3</li>
         </ol>
         ```
    
    In summary, `<ul>` is for unordered lists (items with no specific order), and `<ol>` is for ordered lists (items with a defined sequence). The choice between them depends on the content and the desired presentation of the list on the webpage. -->
